# Shearing Sheet
This code predicts the real time evolution of the shearing sheet, using the framework laid out in my thesis and Binney 2020. Each file does the following:

-`AxisymmetricSheet.py`: Calculate the evolution of the axisymetric shearing sheet
-`ShearingPatch.py`: Groups together multiple wave number and makes predictions 
-`ShearingSheet.py`: Calculates the evolution of a wave with inital wave number in a given disc.
